> #### Instructions for running the code:
>
- the program has 2 windows : first for keeping persisted data or generating new data and second with all the operations for invoices 
- you can run the program because it has already all the generated entities you asked for
- if you do not empty the files, first window will appear
- if you want to go with persisted data, just press the button for it
- else if you want to go with new generated data, just write in the text fields how many data you want to generate for every entitiy and press the button to generate
- if you choose to empty the file, second window will appear instead of first one, because there is no data, but will generate automatically 24 companies, 48 products and 50 invoices
- in the second window, in left, you have a table with ordered invoices which is initialized when windows appears
- in right you have a table with filtered invoices which can be initialized after you complete the text field for filtering with a string and press the filter button
- if you want to pay an invoice, you have to select from ordered table (the left one) an invoice and press pay button
- if you want to duplicate an invoice, you have to select from ordered table (the left one) an invoice and press button duplicate
- if you want to see for an invoice how many days are left until due date, just double click an invoice from ordered table (the left one) and will appear a message with days remaining
