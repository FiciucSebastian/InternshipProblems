> #### Instructions for running the code:
>
- you can run the program
- write in the console how many doctors you want to generate. If your number is less than 8, the program will automatically generate 8 doctors
- also if the console input is not a number you will have to write in console until the input is a number
- for showing all doctors write in console 1
- for showing all patients write in console 2
- for showing number of patients by age write in console 3
- for showing number of patients, time spent and money made for a doctor write in console 4
- for exiting the program write in console 5
- all the results you asked for will be printed in the console and the doctors and patients will also be write in their files


In the zip is also a file for the program's UML Diagram. (it is in draw.io if you want to check it and also a pdf to check it online)

I have also commited the problem on my GitHub, [InternshipProblem](https://github.com/FiciucSebastian/InternshipProblems) , after that check Problem_01.
